PART I. (Load, Store, Add, Sub) 

Please load the data 4($gp) as A, 8($gp) as B, and 12($gp) as C, and do the 
following calculations. 
D = A - C + B, store D to 16($gp) 
E = B + C - 15, store E to 4($gp)
global pointer(gp): A system defined pointer which is used to refer to constant.

PART II. (Branch Loop, System call, Arithmetic Operations)
Please convert the following C-like code to MIPS assembly code. Write a new 
assembly file for this part. 
Description: Please design a “Number guessing game” by MIPS.
This is a game to guess the correct number. The program will randomly 
generate a number, then the player should find the answer in 5 rounds. Every 
time the player guesses, the range will be narrowed according to the number 
the player guesses. 
You should consider the situation that the player makes a guess that is out of 
the range. Please ask the player to retry (and it won’t cost any round).

HW3
Those two exercises are to practice procedure call and recursive call.
